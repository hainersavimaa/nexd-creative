# Nexd Creatives list

This is a test task application for Nexd which is made with VueJS CDN. I chose to use CDN instead of Vue-Cli because it is a very small and simple application and using Vue-Cli didn't give me any noticeable advantages.

## Demo

## Usage

Simply open index.html. All VueJS logic is in assets/scripts/app.js file. Use some SCSS compiler to compile main.scss to main.css.
